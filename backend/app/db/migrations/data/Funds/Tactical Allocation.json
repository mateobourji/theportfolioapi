The fund uses an actively-managed multi-asset strategy to produce absolute or real returns with less volatility than major equity markets over a complete market cycle, typically a period of five years. Rather than managing to track a benchmark index, it seeks to provide returns that are largely independent of market moves. The fund allocates its investments among global equities, bonds and cash, and, generally to a lesser extent, other asset classes, including real estate, commodities, currencies and alternative or non-traditional asset classes and strategies, primarily those accessed through derivative instruments.",
