In view of the generally higher price sensitivity of shares for small- to medium-sized companies (small- and mid caps) as compared with shares of large companies (large caps), risk management is of considerable importance. In this regard, substantial quantities of liquid assets (cash) and/or government bonds may be maintained from time to time, but the capital of the Fund will, in principle, be invested in shares.
