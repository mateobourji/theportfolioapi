        "summary": "The objective of the fund is the realization of capital growth for an intermediate period or longer by investing in non liquid securities and high return debt. With non liquid securities the fund means those securities which are not heavily traded because the information published is few and the market therefore puts them in a high risk profile. With high return dept the fund means bonds and convertibles of issuing bodies like bank loans and trade requisitioning on enterprises for which the market believes they have a high risk profile. The fund is co managed by Faxtor Securities B.V.",
